## Description 🧑‍💻

A complete spring overhaul of my portfolio website, showcasing my latest projects and my future tech/film-related blog posts.

## Stack 🍱

**Built with React, Next.js, Markdown and Sass. Deployed with Vercel.**

The goal was to have a blazing-fast interactive website, and Next.js and its static generator was the perfect fit! 

I wanted to have the easiest existing solution for writing and publishing blog posts. This led me to implement a markdown-based solution, where the posts would be directly written in a dedicated folder in the project and then fetched and displayed with React and its libray **remark**.
